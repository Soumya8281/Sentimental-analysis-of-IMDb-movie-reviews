Sentiment Analysis has been a classic field of research in Natural Language
Processing, Text Analysis and Linguistics. It essentially attempts to identify, categorize
and possibly quantify, the opinions expressed in a piece of text and determine the authorâ€™s
attitude toward a topic, product or situation. This has widespread application in
Recommender systems for predicting the preferences of users and in e-commerce
websites to analyze customer feedback and reviews. Based on the sentiments extracted
from the data, companies can better understand their customers and align their
businesses accordingly. The sentiment analysis is an emerging research area where vast
amount of data is being analyzed, to generate useful insights in regards to a specific
topic. It is an effective tool which can serve governments, corporations and even
consumers. Text emotion recognizing lays a key role in this framework. Researchers
in the fields of natural language processing ( NLP) and machine learning ( ML) have
explored a variety of methods to implement the process with highest accuracy
possible. In this paper the Long Short-Term Memory ( LSTM) and Convolutional
Neural Network ( CNN) classifier are used for analyzing sentiments of the IMDb
movie reviews. It is based on the Recurrent Neural Network ( RNN) algorithm. The
data is effectively preprocessed and partitioned to enhance the post classification
performance. The classification performance is studied in terms of accuracy. Results
show a best classification accuracy of 89.9.
